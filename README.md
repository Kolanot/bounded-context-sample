# bounded-context-sample
A sample sub-domain of a shopping cart

## Overview
This is a throwaway prototype of a shopping cart sub domain, based on the event sourcing/DDD work of myself and [Colin Lyons](https://github.com/lyonscf).

We has a difference of opinion on how our domains should be architected, so we both created prototypes and then walked through each of our solutions. We took the best pieces from each prototype and combinded them together to create a better, consistent model, which we plan to use in our event sourcing framework.

I've decided to keep this repo here for posterity, feel free to have a look through, though our latest version will have a completely different shape.
